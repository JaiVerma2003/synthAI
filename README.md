## Project Overview

This project leverages the Flask framework, Google's Gemini AI model, and LangChain to conduct personalized mock interviews. Users can:

- Select a job role for the interview.
- Upload their resume (in PDF format) to provide context.
- Engage in an interactive, AI-driven interview experience.
- Receive tailored feedback after completing the interview.

## Features

‚ú® **Job-specific interviews**: Interviews are customized based on the selected job profile.
üìÑ **Resume parsing**: The uploaded resume is analyzed to personalize questions.
üí¨ **Interactive session**: Users answer questions one by one, with the next question generated dynamically.
üîÑ **Session management**: Progress is tracked using Flask sessions.
ü§ñ **AI feedback**: After answering several questions, users receive feedback on their performance.

## Technologies Used

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/): Web framework for building the backend and handling routes.
- [Google Generative AI (Gemini)](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/algorithms/gemini): To generate interview questions and analyze user responses.
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/): For text processing and extracting information from PDFs.
- [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/): Utilities for working with file uploads securely.
